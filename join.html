            <p>Faiza Finance is always looking for new members and growth. We are looking to develop a curriculum and have it taught in masjids all over the country. In order to do this we need your help. We are currently looking to establish a board of directors and curriculum developers. Curriculum developers would be responsible for the creation of a financial literacy curriculum that is based on the teachings of Islam. The curriculum would vary based on the age ranges of children K-12th grade. Contribute to our mission by becoming a curriculum developer, donating, registering to have the curriculum taught at your masjid or Islamic school, or simply becoming a member.</p>
